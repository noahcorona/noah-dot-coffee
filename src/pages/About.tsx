            <p>I started developing software at 10 years old, and haven't stopped since! You can still check out my first project, a website, on my portfolio. </p>
            <p>In 2022, I graduated from UC, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I had the chance to work with some great folks at Aptitude Medical Systems while completing the UCSB Capstone project.</p>
